# Earth Map data download script

This is a script to download and process wind data for cambecc's fantastic D3
global map of environmental data. This is part of our effort to use this system
in a museum exhibit at the Conner Prairie Interactive History Park.

This is a work in progress and is [pretty customized to our specific
needs](https://github.com/scimusmn/earth)right now, although I hope to abstract
it more in the future.
